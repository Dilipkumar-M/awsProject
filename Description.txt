Please note the following:

Replace "my-s3-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com" with the actual domain name of your S3 bucket that you want to use as the origin for CloudFront.
In the "Origins" section, you might need to configure the "OriginAccessIdentity" if you want to restrict access to the S3 bucket.
The "DefaultCacheBehavior" section defines caching behavior. You can adjust cache settings based on your requirements.
The "ViewerCertificate" section uses the default CloudFront certificate. You can customize this to use your own SSL certificate if needed.
"DefaultRootObject" specifies the default object to serve when the root URL is requested.
"PriceClass" determines the geographic location of the CloudFront edge servers. Adjust as needed.
Remember that this is a basic template and might need further customization based on your specific use case and requirements.
